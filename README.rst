Hungry Flies
============

Game made for `LudumDare 24 <http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-24/?action=preview&uid=15241>`_

Mommy has just baked a strawberry cake and it's cooling by the kitchen window. Suddenly, hungry flies appear to eat it, but they are smart and can quickly evolve and learn how to escape from the bubbles. It's up to you to blow them up before they eat all your yummy cake.

Development Notes
-----------------

My intention was to place a kitchen window as background image and to place a cake by the windowsill, so the flies could come through the window and eat the cake, as the name of the game says. However, the short time would not let me do it. 

I took the theme to the letter and the evolution is in the behavior of the flies, i.e. their behavior evolves as the time passes by. 

.. NOTE::

    Google Chrome or Firefox is strongly recommended!
